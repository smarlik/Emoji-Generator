# Emoji-Generator
This program generates an emoji, you have to pick a number 1,2,3,or 4, which all mean Happy,Grumpy Sad, or Calm. Once you pick the number the program will print your emoji. I got the idea for this program from a magazine called beanz.
To run this program you must put this into the terminal:

```
jshell --execution local --startup PRINTING "primeFinder.java"
```

The fix for primeFinder was that first you had to make scanner work (`--execution local`) and then enable printf function (`--startup PRINTING`)
